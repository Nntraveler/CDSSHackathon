The Dataset & APIs

We will be using the FDAâ€™s Adverse Drug Events database to explore the side effects and adverse reactions patients across the globe have had to FDA-approved drugs. The API can be accessed through a URL, and returns a variety of information not limited to basic patient information, drug(s) taken, and details on the adverse reaction.

FDA Adverse Drug Events:
FDA Drug Event API:		https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json 
API Documentation: 		https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/ 

To aid our exploration of this database, we may also consider using the National Drug Code directory to connect brand name drugs to their FDA application numbers, which could simplify lookups.

National Drug Code Directory:
NDC Lookup: 			https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/index.cfm 
NDC API: 			https://api.fda.gov/drug/ndc.json 
API Documentation:		https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/ndc/
